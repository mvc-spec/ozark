        Sure, these inner classes might be more efficient if they
        were static, but the code would be harder to read too.

        We ignore Exception all over the place.  Mostly it's on purpose.

        And sometimes we catch Exception even though it's not throw,

    <!--
        Arrays are passed in and out of internal APIs all over the place.
        Mostly this is just fine.  Finding the few places where this might
        be a real issue is a problem for another day.

        Lots of classes extend serializable classes but we never depend

        We do I/O using the default encoding everywhere, usually

        are not.
